description: Run the harness initializer to generate feature tasks from specification
---

# Initialize Harness

Run the initializer to set up the autonomous coding harness from your specification.

## When to Use

Use this **once** after running `/harness-setup`:

1. You've run `/harness-setup` wizard
2. Archon project was created
3. Application specification is stored
4. Feature tasks need to be generated

## What Initialization Does

### 1. Read Application Specification

From Archon documents (created during setup)

### 2. Generate Feature Tasks

Creates 20-50 detailed tasks in Archon based on the spec:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Test steps for verification
- Priority ordering
- Feature grouping

### 3. Set Up Project Structure

Creates appropriate directories:
```
src/
tests/
docs/
.harness/
```

### 4. Initialize Environment

Runs setup commands for dependencies.

### 5. Initialize Git

Creates initial commit with project structure.

### 6. Create Handoff Notes

Updates Archon session notes for coding agent.

---

## Timing Expectations

This takes 5-15 minutes depending on spec complexity.

The agent is generating detailed tasks - it may appear slow but is working.

---

## After Initialization

When complete, you'll have:
- [ ] Feature tasks in Archon (view with `/harness-status`)
- [ ] Project structure created
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Ready for coding sessions

Then run:
```bash
/harness-next   # Start first coding session
```

---

## Task Generation Pattern

Tasks are created with this structure:

```python
manage_task("create",
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    title="Implement user authentication",
    description="""
    ## Requirements
    - JWT-based authentication
    - Login/logout endpoints
    - Token refresh mechanism

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - [ ] POST /auth/login returns JWT
    - [ ] POST /auth/logout invalidates session
    - [ ] POST /auth/refresh renews token

    ## Test Steps
    1. Test valid login credentials
    2. Test invalid credentials
    3. Test token expiration
    """,
    feature="Authentication",
    task_order=90
)
```
