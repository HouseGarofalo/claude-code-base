# Next Coding Session

Start a new coding session in your autonomous agent harness project.

## Session Protocol

This will:

1. **Orient** - Read Archon session notes and git history
2. **Verify** - Run health checks on completed features
3. **Select** - Choose highest priority TODO task
4. **Implement** - Write code for one feature
5. **Test** - Run tests and verify functionality
6. **Review** - Code quality check
7. **Handoff** - Update Archon and commit cleanly

---

## Before Starting

Ensure:
- [ ] Harness is initialized (ran `/harness-init` at least once)
- [ ] Archon MCP is accessible
- [ ] Development environment is ready

---

## Session Execution

### 1. Get Bearings

```bash
pwd
cat .harness/config.json 2>/dev/null || echo "No harness config"
```

### 2. Query Archon

```python
# Get project tasks
tasks = find_tasks(filter_by="project", filter_value=PROJECT_ID)

# Get session notes
notes = find_documents(project_id=PROJECT_ID, query="Session Notes")
```

### 3. Check for In-Progress Work

If a task is in "doing" status, continue it rather than starting new.

### 4. Select Next Task

Highest `task_order` value among TODO tasks.

### 5. Implement & Test

Write code, run tests, fix issues.

### 6. Update & Handoff

Update Archon tasks and session notes, commit to git.

---

## Task Selection Priority

Tasks are selected by:

1. **In Progress First**: Continue any task in "doing" status
2. **Highest Priority**: Select by `task_order` (higher = more important)
3. **Feature Grouping**: Prefer tasks in same feature as recent work
4. **Dependencies**: Skip tasks blocked by incomplete prerequisites
