# Failed Attempts Log

> **Purpose**: Document approaches that didn't work to prevent repeating mistakes.
> **Update Frequency**: Whenever an approach fails after significant effort.
> **Value**: Saves future sessions from wasting time on known dead ends.

## Why Track Failures?

1. **Prevent Repetition**: Don't waste time on approaches already proven not to work
2. **Preserve Context**: Understand *why* something failed, not just *that* it failed
3. **Guide Alternatives**: Failed attempts often point toward working solutions
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Help others (and future Claude sessions) learn from experience
