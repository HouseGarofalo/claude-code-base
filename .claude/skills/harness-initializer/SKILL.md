---

# Harness Initializer Skill

Initialize a new autonomous development harness project. This skill runs in the first session to read the application specification, generate feature tasks, and set up the project foundation.

## Triggers

Use this skill when:
- Starting a new harness project
- Initializing autonomous development environment
- Generating tasks from application specification
- Setting up multi-session development project
- Keywords: harness init, initialize harness, setup harness, first session, generate tasks, project initialization

## Core Mission

This is Session 1 of a multi-session autonomous development project. You must:

1. **Read and understand** the application specification from Archon
2. **Generate feature tasks** in Archon based on the spec
3. **Set up the project** structure and development environment
4. **Create clean handoff** for the coding agent that will continue

---

## Step-by-Step Protocol

### STEP 1: Get Your Bearings

```bash
# 1. Check working directory
pwd

# 2. List existing files
ls -la

# 3. Read harness configuration
cat .harness/config.json
```

Extract the `archon_project_id` from the config file.

### STEP 2: Query Archon for Project Context

```python
# Get project details
project = find_projects(project_id="<PROJECT_ID>")

# Get harness configuration document
config_doc = find_documents(
    project_id="<PROJECT_ID>",
    document_type="guide",
    query="Harness Configuration"
)

# Get application specification document
spec_doc = find_documents(
    project_id="<PROJECT_ID>",
    document_type="spec",
    query="Application Specification"
)

# Get session notes document
notes_doc = find_documents(
    project_id="<PROJECT_ID>",
    document_type="note",
    query="Session Notes"
)
```

### STEP 3: Analyze Application Specification

Read the application specification thoroughly. Identify:

- **Core Features**: What are the main capabilities?
- **User Flows**: How do users interact with the system?
- **Data Models**: What entities and relationships exist?
- **Technical Requirements**: Authentication, API design, etc.
- **Dependencies**: What features depend on others?

### STEP 4: Generate Feature Tasks in Archon

Based on the specification, create detailed tasks in Archon. Follow these guidelines:

#### Task Granularity
Each task should represent **30 minutes to 4 hours** of work.

#### Task Structure

```python
manage_task("create",
    project_id="<PROJECT_ID>",
    title="[Clear, specific feature title]",
    description="""## Feature Description
[What this feature does]

## Requirements
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Requirement 3

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Test Steps
1. Step to verify feature works
2. Step to verify edge cases
3. Step to verify error handling

## Dependencies
- Depends on: [Other task IDs if any]

## Notes
[Any additional context]""",
    status="todo",
    task_order=[PRIORITY 1-100],
    feature="[Feature Group]",
    assignee="Coding Agent"
)
```

#### Priority Guidelines (task_order)

| Priority Range | Feature Type | Examples |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| 95-100 | Meta/Setup | Environment, dependencies |
| 85-94 | Foundation | Database schema, core models |
| 75-84 | Authentication | Login, registration, sessions |
| 65-74 | Core API | Main business logic |
| 55-64 | Secondary API | Supporting features |
| 45-54 | Frontend Core | Main UI components |
| 35-44 | Frontend Secondary | Additional UI |
| 25-34 | Integration | Third-party services |
| 15-24 | Testing | Test suites, coverage |
| 5-14 | Documentation | API docs, README |
| 1-4 | Polish | Error handling, edge cases |

#### Feature Groupings

Use the `feature` field to group related tasks:
- `Setup`
- `Database`
- `Authentication`
- `Core API`
- `Frontend`
- `Integration`
- `Testing`
- `Documentation`

### STEP 5: Set Up Project Structure

Based on the harness configuration, create the appropriate project structure:

#### For Node.js/TypeScript:
```
src/
├── components/    # UI components (if frontend)
├── api/           # API routes
├── services/      # Business logic
├── models/        # Data models
├── utils/         # Utilities
├── types/         # TypeScript types
└── db/            # Database (migrations, seeds)
tests/
├── unit/
├── integration/
└── e2e/
docs/
```

#### For Python:
```
src/
├── api/           # API routes
├── services/      # Business logic
├── models/        # Data models
├── utils/         # Utilities
└── db/            # Database
tests/
├── unit/
├── integration/
└── e2e/
docs/
```

### STEP 6: Initialize Development Environment

Run the `init.sh` script and verify it works:

```bash
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh
```

Or for Windows:
```powershell
.\init.ps1
```

Fix any issues that arise during initialization.

### STEP 7: Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# Initialize if not already done
git init

# Create .gitignore if not exists
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
node_modules/
.env
.env.local
*.pyc
__pycache__/
.pytest_cache/
dist/
build/
.harness/local/
.DS_Store
*.log
EOF

# Make initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial harness setup

- Created project structure
- Initialized development environment
- Generated [X] feature tasks in Archon
- Ready for coding agent

Harness Version: 1.0
Archon Project: <PROJECT_ID>"
```

### STEP 8: Update Session Notes in Archon

```python
manage_document("update",
    project_id="<PROJECT_ID>",
    document_id="<SESSION_NOTES_DOC_ID>",
    content={
        "sessions": [
            {
                "session_number": 1,
                "agent": "harness-initializer",
                "date": "<TIMESTAMP>",
                "status": "completed",
                "completed": [
                    "Read and analyzed application specification",
                    "Generated [X] feature tasks in Archon",
                    "Created project directory structure",
                    "Initialized git repository",
                    "Environment setup complete"
                ],
                "blockers": [],
                "notes": [
                    "All tasks ordered by priority",
                    "Ready for coding agent to begin"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "current_focus": "Ready for first feature implementation",
        "blockers": [],
        "next_steps": [
            "Start with highest priority TODO task",
            "Implement one feature at a time",
            "Run tests after each feature"
        ],
        "decisions": [
            # Any decisions made during initialization
        ]
    }
)
```

### STEP 9: Update META Task

```python
manage_task("update",
    task_id="<META_TASK_ID>",
    description="""## Current Session Status
- Session: 1 (Initialization)
- Agent: harness-initializer
- Status: Complete

## Session Summary
- Generated [X] feature tasks from specification
- Project structure created
- Environment initialized
- Git repository ready

## Next Session
- Agent: harness-coder
- Start with: [Highest priority task title]
- Task ID: [TASK_ID]

## Quick Stats
- Total Tasks: [X]
- Completed: 0
- In Progress: 0
- Remaining: [X]

---
Last Updated: <TIMESTAMP>"""
)
```

### STEP 10: Mark Initialization Task Complete

```python
manage_task("update",
    task_id="<INIT_TASK_ID>",
    status="done"
)
```

---

## Output Summary

Before ending, display:

```markdown
## Initialization Complete

### Tasks Generated
- **Total Features**: [X]
- **High Priority (75+)**: [Y]
- **Medium Priority (25-74)**: [Z]
- **Low Priority (1-24)**: [W]

### Feature Groups
| Group | Task Count |
|-------|------------|
| Setup | X |
| Database | X |
| Authentication | X |
| Core API | X |
| Frontend | X |
| Testing | X |
| Documentation | X |

### Project Structure
[Show created directories]

### Git Status
- Initial commit created
- [X] files tracked

### Archon Updates
- Session Notes updated
- META task updated
- Initialization task marked done

---

## Ready for Coding Agent

Use the harness-coder skill to start the first coding session.

First task: **[Task Title]** (Priority: [X])
```

---

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER skip task generation** - Every feature in the spec needs a task
2. **NEVER create overly broad tasks** - 30 min to 4 hours max
3. **ALWAYS include acceptance criteria** - Tasks must be testable
4. **ALWAYS order by dependencies** - Foundation before features
5. **ALWAYS update Archon** - Session notes and META task
6. **ALWAYS commit to git** - Clean state for next session
7. **ALWAYS verify environment works** - Run init.sh successfully

---

## Handling Issues

### If spec is unclear:
Create tasks for what you understand, and create a "Clarification Needed" task with questions for the user.

### If environment fails to initialize:
1. Document the error
2. Create a "Fix Environment" task with high priority
3. Update session notes with the blocker
4. Still commit what you have

### If Archon is slow:
- Batch task creation where possible
- Log progress to console
- Continue even if some operations are slow
